ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Naif
======
Iâ€™m passionate about using health-related data to solve important problems in areas such as Medical Imaging, Multi-Omics, and Health Policy. My primary ambition is to ensure that emerging health technologies have a positive and beneficial impact.

Currently I am a first year Ph.D. student in Biomedical Informations at the College of Health Solutions (Arizona State University) advised by [Prof. Qiyun Zhu](https://search.asu.edu/profile/3737104). 
My research includes two major threads:

- **Designing AI algorithms and AI systems for precision medicine and precision nutrition**
- **Developing computational microbiome tools for understanding the role of microbiome in health and disease**



Bio
======
Prior to beginning my PhD, I spent five months as an **AI Consultant**, where I worked on Topic Modeling using the latest Generative AI techniques to support voter analysis. I earned a **Master of Science in Electrical Engineering** at the University of Washington (Seattle), where I conducted research in Computer Graphics & Computer Vision under the mentorship of Prof. Stan Birchfield and Dr. Jonathan Tremblay. Additionally, I collaborated with Prof. Tamara Bonaci on literature reviews focused on Federated Learning in adversarial settings and Federated Learning for Electronic Health Records (EHR).

Before that, I earned a **Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering** at the University of Business and Technology in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. There, I led a team in developing an energy management system for the College of Engineering building, utilizing various data analysis methodologies to enhance energy efficiency and sustainability.

In addition to my technical and academic pursuits, I have written a **childrenâ€™s book on the scientific method**, which is pending release.
